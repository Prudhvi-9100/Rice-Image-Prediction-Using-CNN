# Rice Image Prediction Using CNN
Rice Image Dataset is a dataset consisting of 60000(250x250) images in 5 different classes like Arborio,Basmati,Ipsala,Jasmine and Karacadag.Each class contains 15000 images.In this tutorial, I have used Rice Image Dataset to train a convolution neural network model to predict the type of a rice and it's confidence.

## Modules used in this project
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- keras from Tensorflow
- PIL

## Files
-Rice_image_classification_using_CNN.ipynb is a training file which we trained the model using the dataset.
-Rice_Prediction_model.ipynb is a prediction file which we predict the type of a rice.
