# Rice Image Prediction Using CNN
Rice Image Dataset is a dataset consisting of 60000(250x250) images in 5 different classes like Arborio,Basmati,Ipsala,Jasmine and Karacadag.Each class contains 15000 images.In this tutorial, I have used Rice Image Dataset to train a convolution neural network model to predict the type of a rice and it's confidence.
